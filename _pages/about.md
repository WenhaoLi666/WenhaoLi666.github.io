I am currently an Assistant Professor of the College of Business at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rotman School of Management, the University of Toronto. I got my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Management Sciences at the City University of Hong Kong. I am fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Ningyuan Chen](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/), [Prof. Ming Hu](http://individual.utoronto.ca/minghu/) (University of Toronto), [Prof. Zhankun Sun](https://zhanksun.github.io/) (City University of Hong Kong) and [Prof. L. Jeff Hong](https://jinzhi123.github.io/) (Fudan University).

My research mainly focuses on data-driven decision-making and its application in healthcare. For the theoretical part, I am interested in designing algorithms for online and offline statistical learning problems. For the application part, I am interested in finding insightful phenomena through data and connecting them to OM theories.
